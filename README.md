# The Purpose

At first, I was set to write another YA book.
Then I thought, the best way to show the wonders of tech.
Is to render a coding language in snippets that can be romanticized.

A pair -a couple- of years ago, I didn't know how to code.
But I took a class in college and the feet I wore began to float.
Because code can be creative and not only in moving pixels around.
For example, code can rewrite Shakespeare and birth a Dall-E.

But as I typed and pushed more keys, 
There were some things I did not forsee.
Code could run but down a tree.
Teachings were stale, full of int and string.

But then I walked in a New York street.
And saw a pigeon swerve a tree.
I thought, what if I could write the world,
As I Haiku my way onto a programmer's chair?

If I can feed moments in nature to my code,
My code improves and so does yours.
If I can see the world like I see code,
My interaction with the world improves and yours does too.

For when I ventured into code a couple -pair- of years ago.
I didn't know how much I'd grow.
And now, as I am moving back.
I give my art bit wings in byte.
