# The Purpose

At first, I was set to write another YA book. <br />
Then I thought, the best way to show the wonders of tech. <br />
Is to render a coding language in snippets that can be romanticized. <br />
<br />
A pair -a couple- of years ago, I didn't know how to code. <br />
But I took a class in college and the feet I wore began to float. <br />
Because code can be creative and not only in moving pixels around. <br />
For example, code can rewrite Shakespeare and birth a Dall-E. <br />
<br />
But as I typed and pushed more keys, <br />
There were some things I did not forsee.<br />
Code could run but down a tree.<br />
Teachings were stale, full of int and string.<br />
<br />
But then I walked on a New York street.<br />
And saw a pigeon swerve a tree.<br />
I thought, what if I could write the world,<br />
As I Haiku my way onto a programmer's chair?<br />
<br />
If I can feed moments in nature to my code,<br />
My code improves and so does yours.<br />
If I can see the world like I see code,<br />
My interaction with the world improves and yours does too.<br />
<br />
For when I ventured into code a couple -pair- of years ago.<br />
I didn't know how much I'd grow.<br />
And now, as I am moving back.<br />
I give my art bit wings in byte.
